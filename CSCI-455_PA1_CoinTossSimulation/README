CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:



Question 1:
All the codes in this assignment are written by myself, under the direction of assignment description.
The codes to get the dimensions of a string in bar.java and CoinSimComponent.java are modified from the part "Hints on graphics programming" of assignment description.

Question 2:
The probability of two heads in one trial is 25%:
The probability of one head and one tail in one trial is 50%:
The probability of two tails in one trial is 25%.

Actually the trial has four outcomes with the same probability 25%: coin1 and coin2 are both head, coin1 and coin2 are both tails, coin1 with head while coin2 with tail, and coin1 with tail while coin2 with head.
The result "one head and one tail" comprises the last two outcomes, so it is 50% rather than 25% as the other two.


Question 3:
Roughly 2000 trials.


Question 4:
Roughly 2.14 * 10^10.
The largest value of trials:    2,147,483,647 (the largest value of an int type number)
Where the program overflowed:   2,147,483,648
